More and more business models require the exchange and processing of business-critical data. 
The legislator considers personal data to be particularly worthy of protection. 
MYDATA Control Technologies offers both business partners and citizens more transparency and self-determination in the use of their data.
Many existing technologies do not offer a practical solution to these challenges. 
They only enable simple yes/no decisions (i.e., "allow access" or "deny access") and do not provide enough flexibility for the definition of complex usage control restrictions (e.g., "allow access, but only in anonymized form", "yes, but delete data after 3 days").

MYDATA Control Technologies closes this gap: The data owner can define his individual requirements with regard to data security and privacy, which are then technically enforced by our technology.
MYDATA Control Technologies is a software solution for the evaluation, enforcement and management of security and privacy rules.  
For the technical realization, MYDATA Control Technologies intercepts data flows and offers comprehensive control options.
Data in motion can be masked and filtered in fine granular form, for example to make it anonymous. 
The modular and component-based structure of MYDATA Control Technologies allows a simple integration into existing systems.

## Policy Enforcement 

MYDATA Control Technologies offers control points for the enforcement of usage policies, which can be easily integrated into target systems. These can filter and mask information at data interfaces. In addition, MYDATA Control Technologies offers the possibility to perform actions using additional components, such as notification by e-mail. The functionality of the control points and action executions can be extended by means of plugins.

## Policy Language

New policies (rules) for data usage can be written at runtime. Among other things, time and frequency-based uses ("Data may only be used 5 times within a day"), situation-based uses ("Sensitive data may not be viewed on business trips") and masked uses ("For the PSD2 service provider, the middle 12 digits of the IBAN are replaced by an X") can be specified.

## Central Services

MYDATA Control Technologies combines the administration of data sovereignty requirements and technical components in a central administration interface.
