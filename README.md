# MYDATA Control Technologies

MYDATA Control Technologies is a technical implementation of data sovereignty, which represents an essential component for informational self-determination. 
It is based on the IND2UCE framework for data usage control developed at Fraunhofer IESE. 
MYDATA Control Technologies implements data sovereignty by monitoring or intercepting security-relevant data flows. 
This enables fine-grained masking and filtering of data flows at interfaces (APIs) in order to make them anonymous, for example. 
Compared to classical access control systems, MYDATA Control Technologies can enforce partial filtering and masking of data, context and situation restrictions as well as restrictions on the purpose of use. 
Compliance with data sovereignty through changes in data flows is controlled by a set of policies. 
A central management interface offers an editor for creating and adapting rules at run-time. 
The ability to flexibly adapt data usage rules at any time ensures high maintainability and avoids unnecessary complexity in technical integration.
